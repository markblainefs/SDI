<p>I chose to write about skydiving because it is a sport about which I am passionate.  I enjoy skydiving because you can do it alone or in a group and there are countless things to do in freefall and under canopy.</p>
<p>The decisions that I have put in my code involve opening the parachute at the right altitude and handling a malfunction if the main canopy does not open.</p>
